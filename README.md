See the codecademy instruction for the project's intention.

Roadblocks Encountered:
-When writing the willLikelySurvive function: 
    Originally I had written the code using a for loop that would check every index in the array for the existence of 'C' or 'G'.
    I then used a counter to count the number of times the loop successfully ran.
    I created a percentage variable to return the true or false if the value was greater than 60% or not.
    I ran into a problem when I tried to use the ternary format: survivalPercenter > 60 ? true : false. For some reason the code hit an error.
    When I looked at the Codecademy solution, I saw that instead of the paragraph of code that I had come up with, they had only 2 lines of code. 
    I chose their answer, because it looked cleaner and I wanted to work through the code itself. It will server as a good reminder that I need to think of the simplest method of code.
